Every module should have the structure:
- actions (optional)
- components
- pages
- constants (optional)
- containers (just for connection with Redux)
- enums (optional)
- reducers (optional)
- utils (optional)
- api (optional)
- schemas (optional)
- sagas (optional)

This technical solution provides an opportunity to develop your app
with less amount of code and keep it clean.
